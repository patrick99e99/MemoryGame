This is a fun OS X game where you are given 20 hidden image tiles that you turn
over to make 10 matched pairs.

You can reveal all images at once for 5 seconds, or under Preferences, you can
set it to reveal one image at a time and specify a delay for each revealed
image.  This is useful for people who want to practice developing photographic
memory skills.
